## Mission

We build and maintain production-grade open-source software for:
- Remote sensing image processing and value-added imagery workflows
- Geospatial analytics and spatial statistics
- Reproducible benchmarking and evaluation
- Secure-by-default engineering practices and supply-chain hygiene

Our objective is to deliver tooling that is technically rigorous, operationally reliable, and well-documented for practitioners and researchers.

## Guiding principles

- Reproducibility: deterministic options, pinned tooling, documented environments, and benchmarkable pipelines.
- Correctness: validated algorithms, comprehensive tests, and explicit uncertainty quantification where applicable.
- Security: no telemetry by default; secure release processes; integrity verification for downloadable artifacts.
- Responsible use: our projects are intended for lawful and ethical use. Users are responsible for compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and export restrictions.

## Projects

Pinned repositories on the organization profile represent the recommended starting points.

If you are new here:
1. Start with the flagship library repository and its documentation.
2. Review contribution guidelines and the security policy.
3. Check the issue tracker for planned milestones and labeled newcomer-friendly work.

## How to contribute

We welcome contributions in the form of:
- bug reports with minimal repro steps
- documentation improvements
- tests, benchmarks, and performance work
- new adapters and plugins aligned with the project roadmap

General contribution process:
1. Open an issue describing the change and motivation.
2. Submit a pull request referencing the issue.
3. Ensure tests and CI checks pass, and documentation is updated.

Please follow our Code of Conduct and repository-specific CONTRIBUTING guidance when available.

## Security

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:
- Do not open a public issue.
- Email: security@unbihexium.org
- Include: affected component, version, impact assessment, and reproduction steps.

We aim to acknowledge reports promptly and coordinate responsible disclosure.

## Communication

- Issues: use repository issue trackers for bugs and feature proposals.
- Pull requests: use PR descriptions that include motivation, design notes, and test evidence.
- Announcements: published via repository releases and change logs.

## Legal and notices

- Not legal advice.
- Each repository contains license and third-party notices.
- Trademarks and brand assets (if any) are governed by repository-specific policies.
